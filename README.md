# dots
Collection of my own dot config files

## Branches

There's a branch for each OS I use where its .config files are located.

At the moment, those are:
```
ubuntu
```

## Ubuntu

The main purpose of all configurations found here is my new found love towards i3, but that guy needs a lot of configuration adjusting.
