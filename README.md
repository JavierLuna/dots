# dots
Collection of my own dot config files

## Branches

There's a branch for each OS I use where its .config files are located.

At the moment, those are:
```
ubuntu
void
```

## Ubuntu

I use Ubuntu mainly for my work laptop. In addition, I think Ubuntu is better for a professional workstation as it is more stable than others (for example my new fav `void`).

## Void

For my main and personal workstation I'm currently using Void Linux. Void linux is a minimal distro made from the ground up, and I love it!
